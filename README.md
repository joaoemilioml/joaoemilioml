Hi!

I am João Emilio Lages (@joaoemilioml)

I am a Software Engineer that started off in Industrial Automation and then migrated to Cloud Development.
Although I have some experience with frontend (mostly Angular) I consider myself more of a Backend kind of guy.
I love:
- Serverless development
- IoT related stuff
- Data Ingestion and Integration
- Distributed applications specially with asynchronous messaging systems

I have a lot of experience with Azure and I'm currentlty getting more used to AWS.
My first professional language was C# (.NET core), but I also know my way around Python (have developed some relative complex things with it) and I am starting to use Kotlin (having a lot of fun)
Really, I just think that regardless of the language, framework or stack, the important thing is to know your fundamentals, how to find the right information and have a problem solving mentality.
